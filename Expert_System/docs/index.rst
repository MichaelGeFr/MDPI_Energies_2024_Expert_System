Documentation of ES TPCM
=============================================
Exemplary implementation of an expert system for increasing energy efficiency of a throughput cleaning machine (TPCM). The system employs data-driven models to identify inefficient parameter settings, calculate achievable energy savings, and prioritize actions based on a fuzzy rule base. Proposed measures can first be applied to an analytical real-time simulation model of the production machine to verify that constraints required for the specified product quality are met.
